# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide for GitHub Upload

## ✅ Your API Key Security Status: **SECURE** 🔒

Your API key is properly protected and will NOT be uploaded to GitHub!

## 📁 Files Ready for GitHub Upload:

### ✅ **SAFE TO UPLOAD:**
- `index.html` - Main weather app
- `config.example.js` - Template with placeholder API key
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files
- `SETUP.md` - This setup guide

### 🔒 **PROTECTED (Won't Upload):**
- `config.js` - Contains your real API key (automatically ignored)

## 🎯 For GitHub Upload:

1. **Upload these files to GitHub:**
   - index.html
   - config.example.js
   - README.md
   - .gitignore
   - SETUP.md

2. **Your config.js file will be automatically ignored** thanks to .gitignore

## 👥 For Other Users:

When someone downloads your project, they need to:

1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. Get their own API key from OpenWeatherMap
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `config.js` with their key

## 🛡️ Security Verification:

- ✅ API key moved to separate file
- ✅ config.js is in .gitignore
- ✅ Template file provided for others
- ✅ Clear setup instructions
- ✅ No sensitive data in main files

**Your API key is 100% safe for GitHub upload!** 🎉
